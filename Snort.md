# SNORT (IDS/IPS)

SNORT is a powerful open-source intrusion detection system (IDS) and intrusion prevention system (IPS) that provides real-time network traffic analysis and data packet logging. SNORT uses a rule-based language that combines anomaly, protocol, and signature inspection methods to detect potentially malicious activity. 

## What Are the Features of SNORT?
There are various features that make SNORT useful for network admins to monitor their systems and detect malicious activity. These include:

## Real-time Traffic Monitor
SNORT can be used to monitor the traffic that goes in and out of a network.

## Packet Logging
SNORT enables packet logging through its packet logger mode, which means it logs packets to the disk. 

## Analysis of Protocol
SNORT can perform protocol analysis, which is a network sniffing process that captures data in protocol layers for additional analysis.

## Content Matching
SNORT collates rules by the protocol, such as IP and TCP, then by ports, and then by those with content and those without. 

## OS Fingerprinting
Operating system (OS) fingerprinting uses the concept that all platforms have a unique TCP/IP stack. 

## Can Be Installed in Any Network Environment
SNORT can be deployed on all operating systems, including Linux and Windows, and as part of all network environments.

## Open Source
As a piece of open-source software, SNORT is free and available for anyone who wants to use an IDS or IPS to monitor and protect their network. 

## Rules Are Easy to Implement
SNORT rules are easy to implement and get network monitoring and protection up and running.
