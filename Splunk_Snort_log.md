# Splunk

Splunk is a powerful software platform used for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated data, including logs, events, and other types of data generated by various systems, applications, and devices. It provides organizations with the ability to gain valuable insights from their data, enabling them to make informed decisions, troubleshoot issues, detect anomalies, and improve operational efficiency.

## Objective

For my project, I plan to configure both Splunk and Snort. Afterwards, I will forward Snort logs to Splunk for analysis, leveraging Splunk's log aggregation and data normalization capabilities. This setup is used to learn about one of the capabilities of fully functional SIEM.
